        <br/><br/>

        Norse mythology comes from the North Germanic people. <br/><br/>
        It stems from Norse Paganism.  There are numerous Gods, <br/><br/>
        including Odin, the crafty knowlege god, and Freyja, the vengeful, <br/><br/>
        skiing goddess.  The norse mythyology's cosmos has nine worlds, <br/><br/>
        and units of time are often personified as Deities.<br/><br/>
        Thor was the most popular God among the ancient Norse common men.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
        Scholars have studied Norse Mythology since the 17th century, when <br/><br/>
        the ancient texts were discovered and translated. <br/><br/>
        Thanks to the romanticist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_revival">Viking Revival</a>, elements of  <br/><br/>
        the Norse Mythology (most notably, Thor) can be found throughout<br/><br/>
        American popular culture.  The day "Thursday" on the modern weekly<br/><br/>
        calendar is said to be derived from "Thor's Day."<br/><br/>
